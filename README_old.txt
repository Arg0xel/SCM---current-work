SYNTHETIC CONTROL ANALYSIS: CHINA'S ONE-CHILD POLICY
=======================================================================

Analysis Date: 2025-11-18
Treatment Country: CHN
Treatment Year: 1980
Pre-period: 1960-1979
Post-period: 1980-2015

OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains the results of a Synthetic Control Method (SCM)
analysis estimating the causal effect of China's One-Child Policy on
Total Fertility Rate (TFR).

METHOD
------
The synthetic control method constructs a weighted combination of donor
countries that best matches China's pre-treatment characteristics and
outcome trajectory. The difference between China's actual post-treatment
outcome and the synthetic control's outcome is interpreted as the
treatment effect.

KEY RESULTS
-----------
Pre-treatment RMSPE: 0.8691
Post-treatment RMSPE: 0.2513
Post/Pre MSPE Ratio: 0.0836
Placebo p-value: 1.0000

Average post-treatment effect: 0.0221
(China's TFR was on average 0.0221 higher than counterfactual)

Statistical significance: Not statistically significant

DONOR POOL
----------
Number of donors: 103
Top contributors (see donor_weights.csv for full list):
  - Thailand (91.5%)
  - Netherlands (8.5%)

DATA SOURCE
-----------
World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
Outcome: Total Fertility Rate (SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
Predictors: NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, SP.DYN.LE00.IN, SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The synthetic control method suggests that China's One-Child Policy increased total fertility rate by an average of 0.02 births per woman during 1980-2015. The placebo test p-value of 1.0000 indicates this effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels.
